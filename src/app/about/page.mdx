# Why OutreachStud.io

__TLDR__: _Leads are hard to get and, because of the bad experience I had
with the services I picked, I lost trust in the existing solutions that are
SAAS based. Good lists that are enriched using a lot of effort and ingenuity
are then placed in the hands of third parties that are not trustworthy._

Early 2025, Google abruptly terminated most advertising campaigns for our small
business, claiming our products (HTTP proxies, SOCKS, VPNs) facilitated
"deceptive behavior" - an accusation as absurd as blaming knife manufacturers
for criminal acts committed with their products.

Having deliberately diversified traffic sources to avoid dependency on any single
platform, the search for alternatives began immediately.

With SEO being handicapped heavily by AI summaries that started to creep in,
offering a clear insight into the next shape of the industry - that strategy
was out of the question. We're still banking on it but the time for impact
is really high anyway so we need more alternatives. This quest eventually
led to discovering the `r/coldemail` community on Reddit and cold emailing
in general which emerged as a compelling strategy for connecting with potential
business partners and customers. The landscape, however, revealed a complex
ecosystem requiring numerous tools, accounts, and services. While some providers
offer comprehensive solutions, others demand assembling a fragmented technology
stack.

## First service evaluation

Embracing the learning process, the decision favored a comprehensive provider that
appeared to offer everything I needed. While the company name remains
confidential, sufficient details will emerge to paint a clear picture.

After preparing a robust database of 28,000 leads using external tools, the
import process began through their dashboard. Several outgoing email
accounts were procured (as part of the same service), followed by a waiting
period for proper warmup before any sending takes place. `Instant` results
were part of their name and motto so I was pumped.

Returning weeks later to launch the inaugural campaign revealed a disturbing
pattern: essential features invariably resided on premium tiers - everything
I needed was always present on a higher plan, tier or plan extras. Despite the
frustration, calculations suggested that assembling an independent stack or
coordinating multiple providers (enrichment, warming, sending, tracking) would
prove significantly more expensive without prior experience. Within minutes,
$500 vanished from the budget without dispatching a single email still.

Campaign creation unveiled another peculiarity: leads required re-importing
into individual campaigns despite existing in their own respective lists. The
import process consistently failed after processing 753 leads, generating
too-broad error messages that communicated nothing to me. Multiple attempts
yielded identical results stating that `an error occurred`. I meticulously
verified any account limitations to make sure I wasn't exceeding quotas - usage
remained well below any thresholds.

Support inquiries met automated responses and eventual human intervention that
promised resolution within "60-90 minutes, as it's quite hot on chats". No
joke, it's what I got.

After days of silence I began seriously considering any refund possibilities.
To my surprise, I discovered that their terms explicitly prohibited refunds,
effectively writing off the $500+ investment. To quote:

> 5.3 No Refunds. ALL FEES PAID UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE NON-REFUNDABLE
> AND NON-CANCELLABLE. Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that `Company`
> will not issue, and Subscriber is not entitled to receive, any refunds,
> reimbursements, or credits of any kind, including but not limited to
> partial, prorated, discounted, or promotional refunds, regardless of
> whether the `Company` Service is used, unused, or terminated early by
> Subscriber. This no-refund policy applies to all subscription plans...

The frustration became palpable. Exhausted by endless bot interactions
and unresponsive support staff, the decision to cancel came swiftly. With
coherent thoughts barely translating to proper keystrokes I also ask them to
delete my account and all associated data as I could not trust them with my
credit card on file anymore. I had this bad taste before and it almost always
ends up with several more charges due to their incompetence or outright
fraudulent behavior.

While the financial loss remained manageable, it proved sufficient
motivation to explore alternatives. The prospect of another $500 evaporating
during the next billing cycle was unacceptable. That sum is subjective to
the reader. For some it might be a lot, for others - peanuts. For me it is VERY
much considering the fact that I did not send a single email in this entire
period.

## Second service evaluation

Persistence demanded another attempt. The next provider allowed bringing
personally-owned domains (which I purchased through GoDaddy) into their warmup
pool. My configuration included two addresses per domain across five domains,
totaling ten addresses - a modest but adequate amount for getting my feet wet
in a niche that was alien to me. After two weeks, monitoring the warmup
progress revealed disturbing discoveries.

You see, my initial domain import encountered SMTP/IMAP connectivity issues
with one address, necessitating manual verification which I did with the
help of Mozilla Thunderbird. Running macOS with minimal restarts meant
numerous applications operated continuously in the background and this was
the case for Thunderbird. Unexpected out-of-office notifications began
appearing in the connected inbox but I assumed them to be part of a normal
warmup activity. Curiosity killed the cat however, so I prompted deeper
investigation into these automated responses.

The out-of-office messages originated from legitimate companies, including
several major enterprises. These communications contained active links to
genuine products and services, some featuring functional promotional codes.

Further investigation uncovered a shocking revelation: the email addresses were
being utilized for unauthorized cold email campaigns that were not mine. The
volume wasn't excessive, under the radar with merely 5-10 messages daily,
staying below warmup quotas while completely undermining trust in the
platform. After a masimum of 1-2 minutes they were deleted from the inbox.

This was my final straw - fool me twice, shame on me.

## Brings us back - Why OutreachStud.io

For all of the above and because I could not trust another SAAS in this
space. People work way to hard for their leads and campaigns for it to be
handled by third parties that do not have their best interest at heart.

I love building dashboards and I am a full-stack programmer in need of
a side project. 20+ years of experience and I can confidently say that I
have what it takes to build a solid product that I would be happy to use for
my outreach needs.

They say the best projects ideas come from frustration. _This one certainly
does!_

## How can you help?

Even though I am determined enough to build this project on my own, time is
of the essence here since I am unable to work on it full-time. With a big
audience, the licensing should allow for some income eventually but those
times are still far ahead.

I would love to do it full-time or even bring a developer or two on board to
help speed things up. If you are interested in helping out, have a look at
our [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/outreachstudio) or [GitHub
Sponsors](https://github.com/OutreachStud-io/studio/) section.

Other possible ways would be to star our project on Github, share it on your
social media channels or provide exposure in any way you can. Exposure
certainly helps bringing much needed awareness to the project.
