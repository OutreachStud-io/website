Several strategic settings are placed in a waterfall model to ensure your bounce rates
are kept to a minimum.

First, we monitor your bounce rates in real-time and provide
you with insights and recommendations to improve your reputation. If a certain threshold
is reached, we automatically pause your campaigns to prevent further damage to your
sender reputation. You can then take the necessary actions to clean your lists and
improve your email content before resuming your campaigns.

Fallback mechanisms are also placed at the account level to mitigate the risk of
high bounce rates across all projects. If the overall bounce rate exceeds a certain
threshold, all campaigns across all projects are paused until the issue is resolved.
Fallback bounce rate thresholds can be overridden at the campaign level to allow
for more granular control.

Problematic or compromised outgoing email accounts are automatically disabled to prevent
further damage to your sender reputation. You can then take the necessary actions to
resolve the issue before re-enabling the account.
