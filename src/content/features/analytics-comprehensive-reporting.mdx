Our love for building beautiful dashboards is only rivaled by our love for data.
That's why we've built a comprehensive reporting system that gives you all
the insights you need to maximize your outreach efforts.

Clicks, opens, reply rates, bounces, snetiments are all just a few of the
metrics you can track with our reporting system.

Since this is an open source project, no amount of stored data remains hidden
from you.
