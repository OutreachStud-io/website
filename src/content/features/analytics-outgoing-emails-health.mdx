There are a lot of factors that influence your email deliverability.
We monitor the health of your outgoing emails and provide you with insights
and recommendations to improve your reputation.

From monitoring bounce rates, spam complaints, and engagement metrics,
to providing feedback on email content and sending practices,
we help you maintain a positive sender reputation. Also, regular checks
are performed to ensure your email infrastructure is properly configured,
including SPF, DKIM, MX and DMARC records.

Real deliverability tests are planned for the near future, allowing you to
send test emails to various email providers and analyze the results thus,
making a perfectly clear assessment of your email deliverability.
