Allow your campaign sequences to be split-tested against each other. Create
multiple sequences inside a campaign and have the system randomly pick one for
each recipient. This is a great way to test different approaches and see which
one performs better.

Each sequence version will have its own stats so you can easily compare open rates,
click rates, reply rates and so on.

A/B or A/B/C testing is a powerful way to optimize your outreach and improve your
results over time.
