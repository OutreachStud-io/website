By using proxies for sending emails, you can bypass restrictions imposed by
your hosting provider and maintain a dynamic sending environment. This
approach helps ensure that your emails reach their intended recipients
without being hindered by IP address based limitations.

Each proxy will be regularly checked against a list of public blacklists to
ensure optimal deliverability. If a proxy is found on any blacklist, it will
be automatically removed from the pool of available proxies. This proactive
measure helps maintain a high standard of email deliverability and reduces
the risk of your emails being marked as spam.
