It's been shown that emails sent from an ESP to a lead using the same ESP have
a higher chance of landing in the inbox and being opened. This is likely due to
the fact that ESPs have better deliverability rates when sending to their own
users, as they have a vested interest in ensuring that emails sent from their
platform are delivered successfully.

Whenever possible, we match the ESP of your outgoing emails with the ESP of
your leads to increase deliverability and open rates. This is done by analyzing
the email addresses of your leads and selecting the most appropriate outgoing
email account for each lead based on their ESP.
