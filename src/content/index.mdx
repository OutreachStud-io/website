## How is OutreachStudio different?

Our software is open source, which means you can inspect the code,
contribute to it, and even host it yourself if you want to. We believe
in transparency and giving users control over their tools.

We are also strong believers of data ownership in this niche, which is the
main reason why this project started in the first place. With
OutreachStudio, you own your data and everything about it.

- Your database
- Your leads
- Your enrichments
- Your inbox accounts
- Your campaigns
- ...
- Your data
- Keep your secrets

In any other niche, this foundation of principles may sound excessive but
in the outreach and cold email space it's an actual feature. Good ideas and
marketing strategies are being dilluted by external services that own your data
and use it to train their models, or worse, sell it to third parties.
There are no third parties involved except for the services you choose to
integrate with.

Our list of [features](/features) is constantly growing and shaped by our
users. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let us know using the
