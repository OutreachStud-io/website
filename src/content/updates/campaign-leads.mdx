Today I finished the campaign leads page, which allows you to see all
the leads associated with a specific campaign. You can filter by status/label/sequence/ESP,
search by name or email, and sort by different columns. You can also select
multiple leads and perform bulk actions, such as changing their status or
deleting them.

Each lead has a sequence progress so you can see how far they reached and
what their current status is by looking at the labels. Labels can be applied
automatically by letting AI analyze the replies, or manually by you. Some labels
are sequence terminating, such as `Interested` or `Unsubscribed`, while others
are just for your own organization, such as `Follow up later`, `Automatic reply`,
`Out of office`.

These labels will have their own page soon as they will be treated as triggers
for automations. For example, you could create an automation that moves all leads
labeled as `Interested` to a new sequence, or sends a notification to your
team via Slack, webhook or email.
