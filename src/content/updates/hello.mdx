This is our first post on this website. Even though OutreachStudio, as a
project, is well underway, we haven't really talked about it much.

Since this is a big project in all of its facets, I'd like to make sure
everything is well documented and that we have a place to share updates,
roadmaps, and other news. Feedback is also very important so we need to
spread the word and get people involved before we launch.

>About OutreachStudio</IconedHeading>


OutreachStudio it an open source cold emailing software designed to help
sales and marketing teams reach out to potential customers or business
partners. The list of features that we plan to implement will bring it
closer to an all-round sales engagement platform, with a starting focus on
emailing.

The project will be used by our own sales team on several other ventures
that we have going on, so it's not just a pet project. We have a real need
ourselves and we want to build something that we can use and be proud of.
