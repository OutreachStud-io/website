I'm thrilled to announce that I've just implemented labels for leads in
OutreachStudio! This new feature allows you to categorize and organize your leads
more effectively but this is not where we stop. Labels can also be used as triggers for
automations, enabling you to create more dynamic and responsive campaigns.

Each label has a selectable set of triggers that can run automations when applied to a lead.
For example, you can set up an automation to notify your sales team via Slack
whenever a lead is labeled as "Interested". This way, your team can respond promptly
to potential opportunities.

You can also create automations that change the status of leads based on their labels.
For instance, if a lead is labeled as "Follow up later", you can set up an automation
to move them to a specific sequence or send them a reminder email after a certain period.

The label can be applied automatically by AI analyzing the replies, or manually by you.
The AI prompt is provided by you, the user, so you have full control over how the labels are assigned.
