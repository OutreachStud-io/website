Just finished setting up the light/dark themes variables. The theme switch can be
toggled manually or left on the `System` option to follow your OS preference.

The overall look an feel is trying to emulate a minimalist style using just 2
accent colors and the usual ones (primary, destructive, positive, warning).
I'm a big fan of [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and this app is built using
that component library.
